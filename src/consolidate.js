/**
 * CONSOLIDATE: Consolidate the root list of a heap.
 *
 * The next step, in which we reduce the number of trees in the Fibonacci heap,
 * is consolidating the root list of H, which the call CONSOLIDATE(H)
 * accomplishes. Consolidating the root list consists of repeatedly executing
 * the following steps until every root in the root list has a distinct degree
 * value:
 *
 *   1. Find two roots x and y in the root list with the same degree. Without
 *   loss of generality, let x.key <= y.key.
 *
 *   2. Link y to x: remove y from the root list, and make y a child of x by
 *   calling the FIB-HEAP-LINK procedure. This procedure increments the
 *   attribute x:degree and clears the mark on y.
 *
 * The procedure CONSOLIDATE uses an auxiliary array A[0..D(H.n)] to
 * keep track of roots according to their degrees. If A[i] = y, then y is
 * currently a root with y.degree = i. Of course, in order to allocate the
 * array we have to know how to calculate the upper bound D(H.n) on the maximum
 * degree, but we will see how to do so in Section 19.4.
 *
 * @param compare Comparison function.
 * @param l Root list.
